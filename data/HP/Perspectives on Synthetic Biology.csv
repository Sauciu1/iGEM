","3","Some","","Yes but public policy should be driven by people who know and study what synthetic biology is. When people who don‚Äôt know what GMOs are make policy on GMOs, you get an over restriction of science which is helping no one. We need policy makers that are interdisciplinary, who can understand the science but also the ESG impacts of its applications, and make rational regulations based on that. Of course I do think innovation should be regulated, especially when it comes to workers rights (don‚Äôt want to be taking jobs away from traditional farmers, but that can be solved with education programs that keeps non-science workers up to date with new innovations). ","I guess designer babies are a huge controversy. It‚Äôs a really long conversation but ultimately I think the use of genetic modification looks to cure genetic diseases would cause such a massive divide between the people who have access to these medications and those who don‚Äôt.
